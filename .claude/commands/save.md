# Save Progress to Scratchpad

Log the progress of our current session to SCRATCHPAD.md for future context.

## Steps

1. **Review what was accomplished** in this session:
   - What tasks were completed?
   - What files were modified/created?
   - What decisions were made and why?
   - Any bugs fixed or issues encountered?

2. **Update SCRATCHPAD.md** with:
   - Add entry to "Session Log" with today's date and summary
   - Update "Current Focus" if it changed
   - Update "In Progress" with current work state
   - Add any new "Decisions Made" with rationale
   - Update "Next Up" with what should be done next
   - Add any blockers to "Blocked / Needs Input"
   - Note any important observations in "Notes & Observations"

3. **Keep entries concise but complete**:
   - Include file paths that were modified
   - Include build status if code was changed
   - Document the WHY behind decisions, not just the WHAT

4. **Confirm save** by showing the user what was added.

Now read SCRATCHPAD.md and update it with this session's progress.
