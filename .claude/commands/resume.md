# Resume Previous Work

Read context from previous session and continue work.

## Steps

1. **Read SCRATCHPAD.md** to understand:
   - What was being worked on
   - Decisions made and why
   - What's blocked or needs input
   - Next steps planned

2. **Check git status** for:
   - Uncommitted changes
   - Current branch
   - Recent commits

3. **Summarize current state** to the user:
   - What's in progress
   - What's completed
   - What needs to be done next

4. **Ask for direction**:
   - Should we continue where we left off?
   - Are there new priorities?

Resume now by reading the scratchpad and git status.
